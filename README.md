# Metabase static embedding sample apps

This repo contains code samples demonstrating how embed Metabase dashboards in an app using [static embedding](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/embedding/static-embedding).

For [interactive embedding](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/embedding/interactive-embedding), check out the following resources:

## Free static embedding

Embedding Metabase charts will always be free, but we include a "Powered by Metabase" graphic when using the open source version.

If you'd like to remove the "Powered by Metabase" attribution, check out our [paid plans](https://www.metabase.com/pricing/). In addition to removing the banner, you can also customize the fonts and hide the download buttons for questions.
